              With such a concentrated market among cloud storage

              that meets all their personal and professional needs.These

                 Many of the cloud storage applications today often specialize
                 in certain features and lack in others. The result is
                 frustrated users having to utilize multiple applications to
                 achieve different tasks. RainDrops strives to connect it’s

                 Although these are among the top players in the market, there
                 are a few weaknesses that have been brought to light and could
                 definitely be improved on. GoogleDrive is great with a generous
                 amout of storage and a great brand to support it. However from
                 my research many users wish it’s interface was more user
                 friendly. DropBox, another powerful brand, has an awesome easy
                 to use interface along with a fast uploading speeds, however
                 the pricing after your free 5 GB can get pricey very quickly.
                 OneDrive also has a simplistic interface and pretty cost
                 effecient. However if one does not know how to take advantage
                 of Microsoft 360 or a Microsoft user it defeats the purpose.

            I conducting some brainstorming activities around what name and
            color palette would represent a new cloud storage application
            trying to penetrate the market. In doing so I came away with the

              After all the research and branding was completed it was time to
              mock up the low fidelity prototypes and wireframes. When creating
              these wireframes I knew I wanted to create something very
              simplistic and easy to use. There were many instances where I
              tried adding countless features trying to recreating the wheel,
              and we all know that hardly ever works. I went back to my findings
              and kept the minimal viable product (MVP) in mind and went to work.

         The Raindrops dashboard gives the user options in how they would like

         to represent what time of content the user is holding within the dashboard.

         The list dashboard is a for users who prefer the description of their

         with and the size of the content. This also allows the user to view
         more files on one screen.

             and how each option/element  made them feel over-all.

             80% preferred the option B refinement saying it was well laid out
             and added more depth to the application. Users appreciated the
             drag and drop water mark that was centered in the screen notifying
             them it was an option.

       ALOT. Gathering the pivotal pieces for the solution and keeping tabs on
       every important detail of the project was a challenge. I wish I could go
       back and give each and every detail more thought and attention.
       Creating consistent visuals was difficult as well as brainstorming the
       brand and tangibles for the style guide.

        This was my first UX project that I captained along with my mentor. I
        learned so many things around the process and the methods used in
        creating a product. I also learned that testing is your key to success.
        Test early and often and you’ll learn so many things you thought you
        already knew. Although this was a challenging project for me, I feel I
        took away key components from the design process and my next project will
        be a huge improvement from RainDrops.
