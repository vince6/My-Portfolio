             <h1>I’m Vincent Rodriguez.</h1>
             <p>
               <b>A general manager turned product designer.</b>
                 While that may have seemed odd to read, please join me as I
                 take you through my unconventional journey that led me here as
                 a prospective UX designer. It all started through reflection
                 and research. After four years of retail and restaurant
                 management (Target Corporation and Chipotle Mexican Grill),
                 I decided this type of management was not the career choice I
                 continually wanted to pursue. Don’t get me wrong, I gained a
                 tremendous amount of business and leadership experience that I
                 will certainly use towards my future career as well as my
                 personal endeavors. However, I began to question what I really
                 enjoy doing?  The answer would’ve been a lot simpler if I ever
                 found that listing for a full-time paid recreational softball
                 player, or for a company who needed an office assistant to
                 manage everyone's fantasy football team, or even if I would
                 have woken up in time to make the tryouts for the Houston Astros
                 back in college; later that day I heard another kid by the name
                 Jose Altuve locked in the last AA spot, I guess that worked out
                 pretty well for them.
             </p>
             <br>
             <br>
             <p>
               <b>But in all reality,</b>
               the answer was quite simple, it wasn’t a matter of one specific
               motive, however an array of realizations. Realizations that all
               stemmed from tangible change. I always strive to create change in
               whatever I do. Change that I can build through my hands, change
               that I can see through my ideas and my ambition, and ultimately
               being surrounded by a team of individuals who empower, inspire,
               and challenge me. I reverted back to what I majored in and enjoyed
               studying in college, Marketing. I admire the subject of Marketing,
               because just like any concentration of business, you study the
               business to solve problems, but in marketing, you solve problems
               a little differently, mainly through psychology and connecting
               with your users. I enjoyed creating marketing decks and pitching
               them to potential clients we made up in college, I enjoyed
               creating marketing strategies for specific target markets and
               their needs, but I also had a true desire to learn technical skills.
               The technical skills that would still allow me to use my soft skills,
               still allow me to create an experience around a great product or
               service, and primarily a skill-set that would help set me apart,
               that’s when I decided to enroll into a 9 month UX/UI Design apprenticeship.

            <p>
              <b>So you may be asking,</b>
              how do marketing and design really tie in together? In my opinion,
              design really leads to the creation of great products or experiences
              through a deeper understanding of people and their needs. The design
              process is useful not only for building these great products and
              solutions, but rather, for pursuing a more creative and
              open-minded approach to life. Marketing creates interest in a
              brand, but design communicates a brand. All in all I believe my
              interpersonal, collaborative, and business skill set along with
              the tools I gained through the UX/UI course allows me to confidently
              present work to a company's stakeholders while championing and
              creating change in future products and their users.
